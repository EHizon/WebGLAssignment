The reason why I chose to use this license is becuase of the fact that it is a liscence that promotes the sharing of information. It is by all means not used to create a profit, nor anything of the sort that causes any gains from the creator. It is usde for all.

The MIT License states more explicitly the rights given to the end-user, including the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell the software.Therefore, this would be the best license to use.
